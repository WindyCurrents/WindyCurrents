- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WindyCurrents
- I'm just a student who likes to keep stuff on GitHub.
- My repos are mostly school projects so you can see what I'm tasked to do

XPCurrent/XPCurrent is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
